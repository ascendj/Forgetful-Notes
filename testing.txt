# Testing

Testing involves running the model on seperate test dataset of input/output pairs.

The purpose of testing is to measure its performance, and to see how well it generalises to new data.

**Generalisation** is the degree to which performance in training matches performance in testing.

The degree of generalisation depends on how representative and complete the training data is.

This also depends on the expressiveness of the model:

1. **Underfitting** occurs when the model is too simple to capture the true relationship between input and output, resulting in inaccurate prediction.
3. **Overfitting** occurs when the model too complex and captures statistical peculiarities in the training data and leads to unusual predictions.
